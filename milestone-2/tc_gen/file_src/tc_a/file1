Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go

Everywhere I go
I hear the echo of a roar
That keeps rising
On the horizon
Yeah
Walking down the street
I feel the energy
The world is demanding
The spaceship has landed

Now there's no going back, back, back, back, back, back
No, there's no going back, back, back, back, back

I don't see red lights, I just see "Go"
I don't do stop signs, I don't hear "No"
Jump and don't look down
That's how you fly
There's no turning back now
It's win or you die

Don't be scared just
Go [16x]
Don't think about it
Go [16x]

Everyone I know feels like the planet's
Spinning faster and faster
Straight for disaster
No
Shine under the pressure
'Cause the way we deal with you will define us
Pressure makes diamonds

Now there's no going back, back, back, back, back, back
No, there's no going back, back, back, back, back

I don't see red lights, I just see "Go"
I don't do stop signs, I don't hear "No"
Jump and don't look down
That's how you fly
There's no turning back now
It's win or you die

Don't be scared just
Go [16x]
Don't think about it
Go [16x]

I feel it in the air tonight
I'm seeing the light
In the dark ignited
And no one's stopping me now
I'm living my dream
And you're all invited!

I don't see red lights, I just see "Go"
I don't do stop signs, I don't hear "No"
Jump and don't look down
That's how you fly
There's no turning back now
It's win or you die

Don't be scared just
Go [16x]
Don't think about it
Go [16x]

Go where you go
Go where you go
Go where you go
Go where you go

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
